# Algorithm Learning Repository

A comprehensive collection of algorithm problems and solutions designed as a structured learning resource. This repository contains problems from LeetCode, organized by patterns and difficulty to facilitate systematic learning.

## 📚 Quick Navigation

- [**Pattern Reference**](PATTERNS.md) - Common algorithm patterns with templates
- [**Interview Prep**](docs/interview-prep.md) - Interview strategies and tips

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows these principles:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Group problems by algorithmic patterns
2. **Multiple Solutions**: Document brute force → optimized approaches
3. **Spaced Repetition**: Review problems at intervals (1 week, 1 month, 3 months)
4. **Deep Understanding**: Focus on why solutions work, not just how
