## 🎯 Before the Interview

### Study Plan (1-2 Weeks Before)

- [ ] Review patterns from PATTERNS.md
- [ ] Solve 2-3 problems daily
- [ ] Focus on weak areas
- [ ] Practice explaining solutions aloud
- [ ] Review complexity analysis

### Day Before

- [ ] Solve 1 easy problem (confidence boost)
- [ ] Review common patterns
- [ ] Prepare questions for interviewer
- [ ] Test your setup (camera, mic, IDE)
- [ ] Get good sleep

## 💬 During the Interview

### Step 1: Understand (5 min)

1. **Listen carefully** to the entire problem
2. **Ask clarifying questions**:
   - What's the input size range?
   - Can the input be empty/null?
   - Are there duplicates?
   - Is the input sorted?
   - What should I return for edge cases?
3. **Restate the problem** in your own words
4. **Confirm examples** and edge cases

### Step 2: Plan (5-10 min)

1. **Think aloud** - share your thought process
2. **Start with brute force**:
   - "The naive approach would be..."
   - State time/space complexity
3. **Identify pattern**:
   - "This looks like a [pattern] problem"
   - Reference similar problems you've solved
4. **Optimize**:
   - "We can improve this by..."
   - Explain the key insight
5. **Discuss trade-offs**:
   - Time vs space
   - Readability vs performance

### Step 3: Code (15-20 min)

1. **Announce your approach**: "I'll implement the [approach] solution"
2. **Write clean code**:
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Follow coding standards
3. **Think aloud** while coding
4. **Handle edge cases** as you code

### Step 4: Test (5-10 min)

1. **Walk through your code** with the example
2. **Test edge cases**:
   - Empty input
   - Single element
   - All same elements
   - Maximum size
3. **Fix bugs** if found
4. **State complexity** again

## 🔑 Key Phrases to Use

**When starting**:

- "Let me make sure I understand the problem..."
- "Can I assume that...?"
- "What should happen if...?"

**When planning**:

- "The brute force approach would be..."
- "This reminds me of [pattern/problem]..."
- "We can optimize this by..."
- "The trade-off here is..."

**When stuck**:

- "I'm thinking about two approaches..."
- "Could you give me a hint about...?"
- "Let me try a different angle..."

**When coding**:

- "I'll use a [data structure] because..."
- "This handles the case where..."
- "Let me add a comment here to explain..."

**When testing**:

- "Let me trace through with the example..."
- "An edge case to consider is..."
- "The time complexity is O(...) because..."

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not asking questions** - Always clarify!
2. **Jumping to code** - Plan first
3. **Ignoring hints** - Interviewers want to help
4. **Poor variable names** - Use descriptive names
5. **Not testing** - Always verify your solution
6. **Forgetting complexity** - State it explicitly
7. **Getting defensive** - Be open to feedback

## 🎓 Pattern Recognition Quick Guide

| Keywords | Likely Pattern |
|----------|---------------|
| subarray, substring, contiguous | Sliding Window |
| sorted array, pair sum | Two Pointers |
| all combinations, permutations | Backtracking |
| tree, graph, connected | DFS/BFS |
| optimal, minimum, maximum | DP or Greedy |
| fast lookup, frequency | Hash Map |
| cycle, middle element | Fast/Slow Pointers |

## 💡 When You're Stuck

1. **Re-read the problem** - missed detail?
2. **Try small example** - pattern might emerge
3. **Think about similar problems** - same pattern?
4. **Consider data structures** - what would help?
5. **Ask for hint** - it's okay!
6. **Simplify** - solve easier version first

## 🎯 Final Tips

**Time Management**:

- Understand: 5 min
- Plan: 5-10 min
- Code: 15-20 min
- Test: 5-10 min
- Total: ~45 min

**If Running Out of Time**:

- Explain your approach clearly
- Write pseudocode
- Discuss what you'd implement
- Show you understand the solution

**After Solving**:

- Ask if they want you to optimize
- Discuss alternative approaches
- Mention related problems
- Ask thoughtful questions
