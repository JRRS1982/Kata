# Problem-Solving Framework (PEDAC)

A systematic model for solving coding problems.

Process → Example → Data → Algorithm → Code

---

## Process (Understand the Problem)

- Read the description carefully
- Identify inputs and outputs
- Identify rules and requirements
- Ask clarifying questions
- Examine all examples

---

## Example Test Cases

- Understand how the input translates to the output
- Identify edge cases: Do we need to handle empty input?
- Create test cases and confirm expected outputs
- Consider boundary conditions

---

## Data Structures

- What kind of data are we dealing with?
  - Strings? Arrays? Objects? Numbers?
- What data structure best fits the problem?
  - Hash Map for lookups?
  - Stack for LIFO?
  - Queue for FIFO?
  - Tree for hierarchical data?

---

## Algorithm

- Step-by-step process from input to output
- Handle edge cases and valid example inputs
- Break down complex problems into smaller steps
- Consider time and space complexity

---

## Code

- Use everything gathered so far to write the code
- If there are errors in output, adjust your algorithm before looking at the code
- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Test thoroughly
